# Exporting to FBX
First of all, Unity needs the `FBX Exporter` package installed. Next, find the model to export, rightclick and choose `Export To FBX`. In the popup select `Binary` for the export format.

Next in Blender choose `File | Import | FBX` to import and edit it.
## Reimporting in Unity
Select `Assets | Import New Asset` and find the fbx file. After importing make sure to uncheck `Import Cameras` and `Import Lights`.
