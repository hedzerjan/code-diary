# Generating a navmesh at runtime
The default way for Unity to enable you to make a navmesh is by baking it at compiletime, in the editor. To be able to do the same at runtime you need an experimental package called `com.unity.ai.navigation`, the documentation is [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.ai.navigation@1.1/manual/index.html).
